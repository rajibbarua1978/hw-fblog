<p>When Rooted, a predominantly in-person business with three different revenue streams was faced with a make-or-break moment at the beginning of the pandemic, 
    they acted quickly and went “all-in” on digital.</p>
    <p>However, with these new enhancements to their site, and more planned, Rooted is optimistic about their future. </p>
